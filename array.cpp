/*
=> use to store multiple items at a place of same datatype
=> why array ? coz we dont have to create so much variables... sure in future we can add some data in it easily
=> e.g. friendlist of instagram
=> there are other variables also to store multiple datalike linked list , cell balancing bst,hash
=>  benifit of array = elements are stored at contiguous locations
=> array elements accesed used indixes.
=> cout<<arr; gives the address of 1st element
=>  advantages of contigous memory -
=>     1. random access- you can get any element in O(1)
=>     2. cache friendliness - may possible the pre fething of data in cacthe memory - this is not there in bst and linked list.

/*
Types of array  - fixed arrays and dynamic arrays

1. Fixed size array
=> syntax - int arr[100]  int arr[n]   int *arr=new int [n]   int arr[]= {1,2,3,4}
=> in cpp array get values from 2 ways = stack segment , heap segment.
=> while java always at heap


2. Dynamic sized array -> we can add any more inputs later
=> c++ - vector
=> java - arraylist
=> python - list
